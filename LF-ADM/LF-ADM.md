#Course Introduction
We are assuming you have either taken The Linux Foundation's free Introduction to Linux (6th Ed.) at edX (this MOOC - Massive Open Online Course - can be found by clicking here, or by searching the edX website for "Linux"), or you have knowledge equivalent to, or better than what would be gained from taking that course.

LFS101x is free and, even if you feel you do not need to take that course, we recommend you sign up for it; you can at least do a quick browse through the material. Some of the content areas covered in LFS101x are covered in this course as well, usually at a more detailed level, befitting our audience. The topic of package management is one such example. Rather than repeat ourselves, we urge you to reference the introductory course for basic topics not covered here.

There are some other topics which are necessary for system administrators to be knowledgeable about, that we will not cover in this course. In particular:

- Text editors (vi, emacs, nano, gedit, etc.)
- Finding Linux documentation (getting help)
- Manipulating text (sed, grep, awk, cut, paste, tail, head, etc.)
- File utilities (find, locate, file, etc.)
- Printing (configuring printers, managing print jobs)
- Graphical interfaces and their administration
- bash shell scripting
- System installation.
Before you take this course, we strongly recommend that you at least take a look at LFS101x. If you are not completely familiar or comfortable with some of the basic utilities and procedures we will be using in this course, you will probably find they are discussed there: this course is not meant to stand alone.
