# DPKG Essentials
DPKG (Debian Package) is the packaging system used to install, remove, and manage software packages under Debian Linux and other distributions derived from it. Like RPM, it is not designed to directly retrieve packages in day-to-day use, but to install and remove them locally.
Package files have a .deb suffix and the DPKG database resides in the /var/lib/dpkg directory.
Like rpm, the dpkg program has only a partial view of the universe: it knows only what is installed on the system, and whatever it is given on the command line, but knows nothing of the other available packages, whether they are in some other directory on the system, or out on the Internet. As such, it will also fail if a dependency is not met, or if one tries to remove a package other installed packages need.
