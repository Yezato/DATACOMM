# Course Introduction
We are assuming you have either taken The Linux Foundation's free Introduction to Linux (6th Ed.) at edX (this MOOC - Massive Open Online Course - can be found by clicking here, or by searching the edX website for "Linux"), or you have knowledge equivalent to, or better than what would be gained from taking that course.

LFS101x is free and, even if you feel you do not need to take that course, we recommend you sign up for it; you can at least do a quick browse through the material. Some of the content areas covered in LFS101x are covered in this course as well, usually at a more detailed level, befitting our audience. The topic of package management is one such example. Rather than repeat ourselves, we urge you to reference the introductory course for basic topics not covered here.

There are some other topics which are necessary for system administrators to be knowledgeable about, that we will not cover in this course. In particular:

- Text editors (vi, emacs, nano, gedit, etc.)
- Finding Linux documentation (getting help)
- Manipulating text (sed, grep, awk, cut, paste, tail, head, etc.)
- File utilities (find, locate, file, etc.)
- Printing (configuring printers, managing print jobs)
- Graphical interfaces and their administration
- bash shell scripting
- System installation.

Before you take this course, we strongly recommend that you at least take a look at LFS101x. If you are not completely familiar or comfortable with some of the basic utilities and procedures we will be using in this course, you will probably find they are discussed there: this course is not meant to stand alone.

# Course Audience And Requirements
## Audience
This course is designed primarily for system administrators.

We are assuming that most of you are tasked with configuring, running, and troubleshooting multiple machines in what is called an Enterprise environment. While you are likely to have significant experience with other operating systems, you want to learn how to do things properly and natively in Linux, while drawing on your previous knowledge.

It is also likely that you are already using Linux, but have not yet seriously studied topics more complicated than keeping your own personal system running and secure.

This course is not designed primarily for:

- New users without much experience with any operating system relatively new Linux users are advised to take this course after partaking in an introductory course, such as The Linux Foundation's Introduction to Linux (LFS101x).
- Developers (at either kernel or application level) most developers will find this material interesting, and the more anyone knows about operating system theory, kernel internals, applications, etc., the more they will get out of this course. And there are plenty of "power users" who do both administration and developers.
- Experienced administrators concentrating on performance tuning we will discuss some performance tuning issues because administration and performance are clearly linked. However, we will not get into great detail, as this belongs in a more advanced and dedicated performance tuning course, such as The Linux Foundation's LFS426.

# Knowledge/Skills
Basic knowledge of Linux, including installing Linux and using the command line is helpful, but not required.

# Software Environment
The material produced by The Linux Foundation is distribution-flexible. This means that technical explanations, labs and procedures should work on most modern Linux distributions, and we do not promote products sold by any specific vendor (although we may mention them for specific scenarios).

In practice, most of our material is written with the three main Linux distribution families in mind:

- Debian/Ubuntu
- Red Hat/Fedoraâ€‹
- openSUSE/SUSE.
  
Distributions used by our students tend to be one of these three alternatives, or a product that is derived from them.
