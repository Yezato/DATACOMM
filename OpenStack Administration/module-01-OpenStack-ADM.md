# IT Infrastructure
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

Discuss Cloud Computing.
- The difference between cloud computing vs on-premise
- The difference between cloud computing workload vs traditional infrastructure workload
- Learn about cloud type and cloud model (saas, paas, iaas)

Traditional Architecture
What is Traditional Architecture?

A traditional IT infrastructure is made up of the usual hardware and software components: facilities, data centers, servers, networking hardware desktop computers and enterprise application software solutions.

Typically, this infrastructure setup requires more power, physical space and money than other infrastructure types. A traditional infrastructure is typically installed on-premises for company-only, or private, use.

Problem with Traditional Architecture
- Pay the rent for the data center
- Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time
- Scaling is limited
- Hire a team to monitor the infrastructure
- How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire)

# Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the technological capability to use IT infrastructures and services that are not installed on a local computer or server. Using a network (Internet or Intranet), connections are made to external computers or servers that provide appropriate resources. These services are both provided and used exclusively via technical interfaces, protocols or browsers.

Each cloud service (storage space, processing power, application software) is accessed dynamically and in accordance with demand, and is also calculated depending on usage. Companies do not need to make high-cost investments for providing, installing and maintaining their own computer systems, which in turn makes it possible to plan the availability of the applications and their actual costs.

## Cloud Characteristics

1. On-demand self-service
The Cloud services do not require any human administrators or intervention, the user themselves are able to provision and manage computing resources as needed.

2. Broad network access
The Computing services are generally provided over standard networks and heterogeneous devices.

3. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
The IT resource (e.g., Compute, Networks, Storage, Applications, and Database services) present are shared across multiple applications and occupants in an uncommitted manner. Multiple clients are provided service from the same physical resource of the cloud.

4. Rapid elasticity and scalability
The Computing services should have IT resources that are able to scale out and quickly and on a needed basis. Whenever the user requires services they will be provided to him and it is scale-out as soon as the requirement of the user gets over.

5. Measured service
The resource utilization is tracked and monitored for each application and occupant, it will provide both the user and the resource provider and they are accountable for what they have been used. This is done for various reasons like monitoring billing, security concerns, and effective use of resources.

## Cloud Computing vs On Premise
Essentially, the fundamental difference between cloud vs on-premise software is where it resides. On-premise software is installed locally, on your business computers and servers, where cloud software is hosted on the vendorâ€™s server and accessed via a web browser.

As well as accessibility, there are a raft of other things that need to be considered when making a decision., including software ownership, cost of ownership, software updates and additional services, such as support and implementation.

Here is a comparison chart of on-premise versus cloud
