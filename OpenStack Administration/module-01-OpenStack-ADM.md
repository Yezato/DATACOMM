# IT Infrastructure
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

Discuss Cloud Computing.
- The difference between cloud computing vs on-premise
- The difference between cloud computing workload vs traditional infrastructure workload
- Learn about cloud type and cloud model (saas, paas, iaas)

Traditional Architecture
What is Traditional Architecture?

A traditional IT infrastructure is made up of the usual hardware and software components: facilities, data centers, servers, networking hardware desktop computers and enterprise application software solutions.

Typically, this infrastructure setup requires more power, physical space and money than other infrastructure types. A traditional infrastructure is typically installed on-premises for company-only, or private, use.

Problem with Traditional Architecture

Pay the rent for the data center
Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance
Adding and replacing hardware takes time
Scaling is limited
Hire a team to monitor the infrastructure
How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire)
