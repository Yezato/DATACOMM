# IT Infrastructure
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

Discuss Cloud Computing.
- The difference between cloud computing vs on-premise
- The difference between cloud computing workload vs traditional infrastructure workload
- Learn about cloud type and cloud model (saas, paas, iaas)

Traditional Architecture
What is Traditional Architecture?

A traditional IT infrastructure is made up of the usual hardware and software components: facilities, data centers, servers, networking hardware desktop computers and enterprise application software solutions.

Typically, this infrastructure setup requires more power, physical space and money than other infrastructure types. A traditional infrastructure is typically installed on-premises for company-only, or private, use.

Problem with Traditional Architecture
- Pay the rent for the data center
- Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time
- Scaling is limited
- Hire a team to monitor the infrastructure
- How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire)

# Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the technological capability to use IT infrastructures and services that are not installed on a local computer or server. Using a network (Internet or Intranet), connections are made to external computers or servers that provide appropriate resources. These services are both provided and used exclusively via technical interfaces, protocols or browsers.

Each cloud service (storage space, processing power, application software) is accessed dynamically and in accordance with demand, and is also calculated depending on usage. Companies do not need to make high-cost investments for providing, installing and maintaining their own computer systems, which in turn makes it possible to plan the availability of the applications and their actual costs.

## Cloud Characteristics

1. On-demand self-service
The Cloud services do not require any human administrators or intervention, the user themselves are able to provision and manage computing resources as needed.

2. Broad network access
The Computing services are generally provided over standard networks and heterogeneous devices.

3. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
The IT resource (e.g., Compute, Networks, Storage, Applications, and Database services) present are shared across multiple applications and occupants in an uncommitted manner. Multiple clients are provided service from the same physical resource of the cloud.

4. Rapid elasticity and scalability
The Computing services should have IT resources that are able to scale out and quickly and on a needed basis. Whenever the user requires services they will be provided to him and it is scale-out as soon as the requirement of the user gets over.

5. Measured service
The resource utilization is tracked and monitored for each application and occupant, it will provide both the user and the resource provider and they are accountable for what they have been used. This is done for various reasons like monitoring billing, security concerns, and effective use of resources.

## Cloud Computing vs On Premise
Essentially, the fundamental difference between cloud vs on-premise software is where it resides. On-premise software is installed locally, on your business computers and servers, where cloud software is hosted on the vendorâ€™s server and accessed via a web browser.

As well as accessibility, there are a raft of other things that need to be considered when making a decision., including software ownership, cost of ownership, software updates and additional services, such as support and implementation.

Here is a comparison chart of on-premise versus cloud

# Cloud Models
## SaaS (Software as a service)

![image](https://github.com/Yezato/DATACOMM/assets/95903200/759b4656-e583-4a96-9483-326e65466920)


Software as a Service, also known as cloud application services, represents the most commonly utilized option for businesses in the cloud market. SaaS utilizes the internet to deliver applications, which are managed by a third-party vendor, to its users. A majority of SaaS applications run directly through your web browser, which means they do not require any downloads or installations on the client side.

SaaS Characteristics
- Managed from a central location
- Hosted on a remote server
- Accessible over the internet
- Users not responsible for hardware or software updates

## PaaS (Platform as a service)

Cloud platform services, also known as Platform as a Service (PaaS), provide cloud components to certain software while being used mainly for applications. PaaS delivers a framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create customized applications. All servers, storage, and networking can be managed by the enterprise or a third-party provider while the developers can maintain management of the applications.

## PaaS Characteristics
Builds on virtualization technology, so resources can easily be scaled up or down as your business changes
Provides a variety of services to assist with the development, testing, and deployment of apps
Accessible to numerous users via the same development application
Integrates web services and databases
IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)


Cloud infrastructure services, known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), are made of highly scalable and automated compute resources. IaaS is fully self-service for accessing and monitoring computers, networking, storage, and other services. IaaS allows businesses to purchase resources on-demand and as-needed instead of having to buy hardware outright.

IaaS Characteristics

Resources are available as a service
Cost varies depending on consumption
Services are highly scalable
Multiple users on a single piece of hardware
Organization retain complete control of the infrastructure
Dynamic and flexible
Common Example of Each Cloud Model


Cloud Model Responsibility (pizza models)


STaaS (Storage as a Service)
Storage as a Service is a type of Cloud Computing service, in which service providers offer data storage capacity services to their customers.

Advantage of STaaS

Storage costs Personnel, hardware and physical storage space expenses are reduced.

Disaster recovery Having multiple copies of data stored in different locations can better enable disaster recovery measures

Scalability With most public cloud services, users only pay for the resources that they use.

Syncing Files can be automatically synced across multiple devices

Security Security can be both an advantage and a disadvantage, as security methods may change per vendor. Data tends to be encrypted during transmission and while at rest.

CaaS (Containers as a Service)
Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) is a cloud service that helps manage and deploy apps using container-based abstraction. CaaS can be deployed on-premises or in a cloud.

Benefits of CaaS - Users pay only for the CaaS resources they use Such as compute instances, load balancing and scheduling capabilities. - It is easier to scale up a container using CaaS.
